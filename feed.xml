                <p>Team Zero is a guild which originated on The Maelstrom during the Legion expansion. A group of likeminded memerino's who fought through it with all their might to defeat the evil in Azeroth.</p>
<p>Some peopleÂ stopt playing, some went to different guilds. Team Zero was dead. Now it's almost time to start battling the filthy alliance once more. Team Zero will come back the next expansion. Bigger, better, Team Zero Reborn.</p>
